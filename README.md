## What does TradeTrain do behind the scenes?
With the use of a **React** + **Vite** frontend, and a **NodeJS** and **Firebase** backend, our app [TradeTrain](https://tradetrain.owenn.dev) condenses a trading day into around 5 minutes and lets traders practice without risk of consequences on our curated market data.

We also use **Firebase Datastore** to persist user data to a database allowing real-time multiplayer competitiveness through the leaderboard and allowing the user to log back in and continue where the last were.
