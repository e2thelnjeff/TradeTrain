// A narrative:  

//In the beginning... idea... 
//then I installed react, some missteps, then installed node
// meanwhile our heroes Owenn and Jeff were researching data API's and made a decision 
// then sir Owenn went and got the data in a couple of forms: excel and json
// then jeff got out of his own way and got node and react talking and got a quote from owen's data forwarded from the server to the front-end react layer
// then owenn got all his data installed and started fetching it and displaying it 
//
//ideally, this could be a game ppl play for fun, 
//hopefully, firms will want to give it to their traders to play for fun
//and maybe by watching them PLAY they'll learn soemthing about their traders,
//teach some of them
//and maybe the traders will notice something about themselves
